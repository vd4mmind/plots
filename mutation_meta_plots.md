## MAGI

MAGI is a tool for annotating, exploring, and analyzing gene sets that may be associated with cancer.
View aberrations in and interactions among gene sets.
Upload your mutation data
View in combination with TCGA Pan-Cancer data.
Generate dataset summaries.
Collaboratively annotate aberrations and interactions while exploring your data.
View the aberrations in a tumor sample, prioritized by their annotations.

##OASIS

About OASIS
OASIS is an open-access web portal that enables cancer researchers to perform exploratory and integrative analyses of somatic mutation, copy number changes (CNV) and gene expression data from thousands of tumor, normal tissues and cell lines representing a broad spectrum of malignancies.

OASIS is developed by Pfizer Oncology Research Computational Biology in collaboration with Research Business Technology (RBT). Please cite "OASIS: A web-based platform for exploratory analysis of cancer genome and transcriptome data (manuscript in preparation)" when publishing results based on OASIS.

Datasets
TCGA:
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project is a joint effort of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) to accelerate our understanding of the molecular basis of cancer through the application of genome analysis technologies, including large-scale genome sequencing. Please follow TCGA publication guidelines when using TCGA data in your publications.

CCLE1:
The Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) project is a collaboration between the Broad Institute, and the Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research and its Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation to conduct a detailed genetic and pharmacologic characterization of a large panel of human cancer models. The CCLE provides public access to genomic data for about 1000 cell lines. Please follow CCLE Terms of Usage when using CCLE data in your research.

GTEx2:
The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project aims to provide a resource with which to study human gene expression and regulation and its relationship to genetic variation. This project will collect and analyze multiple human tissues from donors who are also densely genotyped, to assess genetic variation within their genomes.

ACRG-HCC3:
The ACRG-HCC dataset from the Asian Cancer Research Group contains array-based gene expression data and copy number variation, somatic mutation data based on whole genome sequencing (WGS) of a predominantly HBV driven Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cohort.

Samsung-HCC4:
The Samsung-HCC dataset was generated through collaboration between Pfizer Oncology Research and the Samsung Medical Center (SMC) in South Korea. It contains array-based gene expression and copy number variation data from a HCC cohort.

HKU-GC5:
The HKU-GC dataset was generated through collaboration between Pfizer Oncology Research and the University of Hong Kong. It contains array-based gene expression, copy number variation data as well as mutation data based on whole exome sequencing (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) on a cohort of gastric cancer patients.

METABRIC6:
The METABRIC dataset contains clinical traits, expression, CNV profiles, and SNP genotypes derived from breast tumors collected from participants of the METABRIC trial.

BioMart7:
The OASIS web portal was developed based on a custom version of the BioMart framework designed for oncogenomics data analysis8. The BioMart project provides free software and data services to the international scientific community in order to foster scientific collaboration and facilitate the scientific discovery process. We sincerely thank Arek Kasprzyk and the ICGC data portal development team for help with implementation of the BioMart framework.
